# Team Clawfather — Integration & Release Report (Prompt 11)

**Date:** July 19, 2026
**Integrator:** Absoloop Builder (Claude, team lead) + `drift-auditor` teammate (read-only cross-surface audit)
**Branch:** `absolooply-incredible` (single working tree; delivery mode is local — changes are left unstaged for the operator to commit)
**Base commit at integration time:** `fa45579` (`fa4557966f4ac5dd7226f3613ee27036a93a8a6b`)

---

## 1. Integration scope and method

All Wave 1–3 work (runbook Prompts 0A–10) was implemented sequentially in **one working tree** rather than in per-agent worktrees, so Prompt 11's "merge candidate diffs" step reduces to: verify the single tree is internally consistent (drift audit, §3), re-run every release gate on it (§2), and confirm the documentation set matches the code (§4). The contract-first integration order (contract → migration → web foundation → teams/invites → desktop sync → dashboards → revoke/delete → docs) was enforced chronologically by the wave sequence itself; no diffs were merged by file count or agent confidence.

No P1 feature was merged; the tree contains the P0 vertical slice plus the Wave 3 hardening passes recorded in the runbook §0 table.

## 2. Release gates — commands, exit codes

Run July 19, 2026 on the final tree, exactly as written:

| Gate | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Focused cloud privacy tests | `npm run test:cloud` | exit 0 — **10/10** pass, 0 fail |
| Wave gate (desktop-cloud + web tests + web build) | `npm run verify:wave3` | exit 0 — 60/60 desktop-cloud tests, 102/102 web tests, **12 routes / 11 static pages** (route list captured: `/`, `/_not-found`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/error`, `/dashboard`, `/download`, `/download/artifact`, `/invite`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/teams/[teamId]`, `/teams/[teamId]/briefing`, + middleware) |
| Root build | `npm run build` | exit 0 (`tsc -b` + pricing check + vite build; one non-blocking chunk-size warning >500 kB) |
| Web production build | `npm run web:build` | exit 0 (runs inside `verify:wave3` above) |
| `cargo check` | **Not required** — `git diff main --name-only -- 'apps/desktop/src-tauri' '*.rs'` returns zero changed native files | n/a |
| Secret scan | `grep -rInE "(sk-…|sbp_…|service_role…eyJ|eyJhbGciOi)"` over `apps packages supabase docs README.md .env.example` | Clean — the only hit is the privacy-critic report quoting its own scan pattern; no keys, JWTs, or project URLs in the tree |
| npm audit (root + `apps/web`) | `npm run audit:check` | exit 0 — **0 vulnerabilities in both workspaces** (July 19, 2026). Before remediation, `apps/web` reported 2 moderate findings, both one root cause: `postcss` 8.4.31 (< 8.5.10, XSS via unescaped `</style>`, GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) pinned inside `next@16.2.10`. npm's suggested fix (semver-major downgrade to `next@9.3.3`) was rejected; instead `apps/web/package.json` gained `overrides: { "postcss": ">=8.5.10" }`, reinstalled via `npm run audit:fix:web` → postcss 8.5.20. Regression gates re-run after the fix: `test:cloud` 10/10, `verify:wave3` exit 0 (60/60 + 102/102 + web build), root `build` exit 0. Before/after JSON captured in `.absoloop/evidence/audit-raw.txt` and `.absoloop/evidence/audit-after-fix.json`. |
| Supabase migration/RLS verification | **Environment-blocked** — no Supabase CLI or psql on this machine (documented since Prompt 2). `supabase/tests/team_cloud_rls.sql` exists but has not executed; RLS behavior remains unproven live. | pending operator |
| Synthetic golden path ×2 | **Environment-blocked** — the manual golden path (manager creates team → invite → member joins → authenticated download → desktop sign-in → preview → manual sync → manager dashboard → briefing → metric removal → resync → delete/revoke) requires a live Supabase stack. The sequence is scripted in Prompt 12's demo package; it has **not** been executed live. | pending operator |

**Not weakened:** no test, RLS policy, privacy copy, or build gate was modified to produce these results.

## 3. Drift resolution (Prompt 11's eight dimensions)

A read-only teammate audited all eight drift dimensions across the migration, web app, desktop services, shared contract, and docs. The first audit's results were lost to a session budget cutoff before they could be recorded here; the audit was **re-run in full on July 19, 2026** by a fresh read-only `drift-auditor` teammate and its results are recorded verbatim in §3.1. Verdict: **8/8 CONSISTENT — no naming, semantic, or env drift**; two benign latent caveats noted below the table (neither is a release blocker).

### 3.1 Audit results (re-run July 19, 2026)

| # | Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Table/column/type names | CONSISTENT | Desktop `WorkloadSnapshotRow` (cloudPolicy.ts:338-363) names every column in the migration (team_cloud_v1.sql:103-131) exactly; web `SNAPSHOT_COLUMNS` (snapshots.ts:18-21) selects real columns of `latest_team_snapshots` (sql:687-693). Minor looseness only: DB checks `context_switch_score`/`wip_load_score` 0–100 (sql:169-174) while the builder emits 0–1 (sharedSnapshot.ts:172,180) — compatible, not conflicting. |
| 2 | Share-level semantics | CONSISTENT | `'summary'\|'categories'\|'projects'` identical in cloud.ts:17, migration CHECK (sql:137-139) and cloudPolicy.ts:98; the DB level-shape constraint (sql:188-198) exactly mirrors the builder's gating (categories → category+mode, projects → +projects; sharedSnapshot.ts:418-419,447-453). |
| 3 | Env var names | CONSISTENT | Root .env.example `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = cloudClient.ts:37-38; apps/web/.env.example `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`_ANON_KEY` = lib/supabase/config.ts:14-15; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_TEAM_BRIEFING_MODEL` = briefing.ts:566-567; `WEEKFORM_ARTIFACT_*`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = download.ts:48-58; `OPENAI_MODEL`/`OPENAI_VISION_MODEL` read in apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs. No orphans found. |
| 4 | Metric null/omission | CONSISTENT | Builder omits disabled/non-finite metrics (sharedSnapshot.ts:410-416), row mapper turns absence into SQL NULL never 0 (cloudPolicy.ts:365-367,396-405), migration permits NULL per metric (sql:147-177), and web keeps null and excludes it from aggregates (snapshots.ts:45-51; workload.ts:108-121,176-183). |
| 5 | Snapshot ID / idempotency | CONSISTENT | Same field `client_snapshot_id`; desktop upsert `on_conflict=user_id,client_snapshot_id` (cloudClient.ts:231) matches `unique (user_id, client_snapshot_id)` (sql:135); desktop mints/persists a real uuid (useCloudSync.ts:80-88) for the uuid column (sql:105). Latent caveat: the builder's fallback id `wfsnap1-${fingerprint}` (sharedSnapshot.ts:459) is not a uuid and would be rejected by Postgres, but the desktop path always rebuilds with the reserved uuid before upload. |
| 6 | Invite token behavior | CONSISTENT | Web inserts SHA-256 hex only (teams/actions.ts:145 via invites.ts:33-35) matching `token_hash ~ '^[a-f0-9]{64}$'` (sql:94); RPC hashes with `extensions.digest(...,'sha256')` (sql:439); 7-day TTL (invites.ts:16) fits the 30-day DB cap (sql:96); single-use enforced by `accepted_at` check + `for update` (sql:445-452) and web maps that exact error (invites.ts:122-124). |
| 7 | Role names | CONSISTENT | `owner/manager/member` in migration CHECK (sql:73), cloud.ts:145, cloudClient.ts:16 (`CloudTeamRole`), web teams.ts:37-38 (`isManagerRole` = owner\|\|manager, matching `private.is_team_manager` sql:262); invites restricted to manager/member both in DB (sql:90) and web (actions.ts:144 inserts `role: "member"`). |
| 8 | Last-sync / freshness | CONSISTENT | Desktop `lastSuccessAt` is local bookkeeping only (cloud.ts:121-132; scheduler cadence, cloudScheduler.ts:143-146); the dashboard classifies freshness from `observed_at` (workload.ts:127-141), which is set to the same `now` used at build-and-upload (useCloudSync.ts:65), and `FRESH_MAX_HOURS = 26` (workload.ts:29) matches the fixed 60-min interval (cloud.ts:56) + slack. Caveat: unchanged content is never re-uploaded (cloudScheduler.ts:141-142), so an actively syncing member with unchanged data will honestly age toward "stale" on the dashboard — documented behavior, not drift. |

**Latent caveats (non-blocking, recorded for post-hackathon follow-up):** (a) the builder's fallback `clientSnapshotId` (`wfsnap1-${fingerprint}`, sharedSnapshot.ts:459) is not a UUID and would be rejected by the uuid column if any future caller skipped the desktop path's UUID-minting step; (b) a member whose data is unchanged is intentionally never re-uploaded, so their dashboard freshness honestly ages toward "stale" even while auto-sync is active.

## 4. Documentation set

Per Prompt 11's update list, current state on this tree:

- `README.md` — updated in the Wave 1–3 validation pass (real test-suite list, product story). Re-verified present.
- `docs/PRIVACY.md` — includes desktop cloud sync + Team Briefing sections (Prompt 5/8 follow-ups closed).
- `docs/BUILD_WEEK_2026.md` — Waves 1–3 provenance section present; Wave 4 entry added by Prompt 12.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — unchanged; setup did not change in Wave 4 (no edit required by the prompt's own condition).
- `apps/web/README.md` — documents env vars and artifact upload steps (Prompt 9).
- `.env.example` + `apps/web/.env.example` — verified against actual code reads in both directions during the Wave 1–3 validation pass; re-checked by the drift audit (dimension 3).

## 5. Demo accounts setup

`supabase/seed.sql` (132 lines, synthetic-only) seeds a local stack via `supabase db reset`. It contains no passwords, service keys, project URLs, or real emails; seeded `auth.users` rows have NULL `encrypted_password` and cannot be signed into. For an interactive demo: `supabase start`, create throwaway users in Studio (Auth → Users), and the `on_auth_user_created` trigger bootstraps profiles; the seed header documents substituting their UUIDs into the `public.*` rows.

## 6. Known limitations (release-blocking candor)

1. **Production RLS proof remains separate** — the local pgTAP suite is executable through `npm run test:supabase:rls`, but its pass does not prove linked or production migration/configuration state.
2. ~~`npm audit` blocked by this harness~~ — **resolved July 19, 2026**: `npm run audit:check` reports 0 vulnerabilities in both workspaces after the `postcss >=8.5.10` override in `apps/web` (see §2).
3. Live hosted Supabase auth/sync/storage-signing, the live OpenAI briefing model, and desktop live-app soak are unexercised on this machine; deterministic or fail-closed paths are the demonstrated paths.
4. Copy-link invites only (no email provider). No public Mac DMG ships; trusted distribution remains unavailable until Developer ID signing, notarization, stapling, checksum verification, and private hosting succeed.
5. Auto-sync that exhausts the 1/5/15-minute retry ladder pauses until re-arm/reconnect/manual sync.

## 7. Evidence trail (public-safe)

- Runbook §0 status table: `docs/WEEKFORM_CODEX_PARALLEL_PROMPT_RUNBOOK.md` — per-prompt evidence with dates.
- Privacy critic report: `docs/hackathon/TEAM_CLAWFATHER_PRIVACY_CRITIC_REPORT.md` (no BLOCKER/HIGH; both MEDIUMs remediated with regression tests).
- Taskboard ledger: `docs/hackathon/TEAM_CLAWFATHER_TASKBOARD.md`.
- Provenance: `docs/BUILD_WEEK_2026.md`.
- Commits on branch (pre-existing): `fa45579`, `542d913`, `ae25396`, `b9019ac`, `1c08a6e`; Wave 3–4 work is in the uncommitted working tree by design (local delivery mode — operator commits after acceptance).
